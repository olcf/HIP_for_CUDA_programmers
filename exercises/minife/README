# miniFE

Based on https://github.com/Mantevo/miniFE

## To build

```
$ module load gcc cuda/11.5.2 hip-cuda
$ cd src
$ make
```

## To run a test
```
$ bsub submit.lsf
```

## Task
1. Identify files in the `src`, `utils`, `fem` directories to be hipified
2. hipify them
3. modify the src/Makefile and build the application
4. Submit a job with the compiled code. Use the given `submit.lsf` as your guide.

See the `solution` directory for an example of how to hipify the files and also rename
them to not use 'cuda' as part of your variable or user defined function names or file names.

## Note
You will find a whole bunch of nvtx calls for profiling in the various files, you can choose
to leave them in or take them out manually. hipify-perl won't remove those. 
hipcc will still compile (since it uses nvcc underneath) 
as long as there is a `-l nvToolsExt` during the link step. See the solution's makefile 
in `solution/src/Makefile` .

You will also see that the output will state that the solution is not verified. This is an issue
in the original miniFE code also. Don't worry about that. Just work on hipifying and getting it to
run.
